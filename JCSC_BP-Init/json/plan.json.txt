  "ACTIVITY COST ESTIMATES" : {
    "01 Introduction" : "Activity Cost Estimates are a valuable project management tool for determining the costs for a project. Much like how a project’s work is broken down into activities and work packages, the activity cost estimate breaks the project’s costs down to the activity level in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of the estimate.",
    "02 Description" : "The activity cost estimate considers each project activity and the costs associated with completing the activity. These costs include direct costs for project resources, indirect costs which may be passed on to the project, and the amount held in contingency reserve for the activity. A given activity may have many resources allocated to it which all must be accounted for as part of the estimate for that activity. One characteristic of the activity cost estimate is documenting how the estimate was determined. This is usually done by either analogous or parametric estimating. Analogous estimating is done using similar past projects or activities to estimate cost. Parametric estimating is done by determining and using a unit cost calculated over a duration or quantity of units. Parametric estimating is usually more accurate and should result in a higher confidence level. Another characteristic of the activity cost estimate is that it often uses a range for the activity’s cost estimate as well as a confidence level. At different stages of project planning some activities may be more well-defined which may result in a much higher confidence level than that of an activity with more unknowns. It is important to note that like most project management documentation, the activity cost estimate should continue to be revised and improved throughout the project’s lifecycle.",
    "03 Summary" : "In general, the more information and detail that is available for an activity, the more accurate the activity cost estimate will be. Once activity cost estimates are completed for all of a project’s activities, these can then be used to develop the overall project cost estimate.",

  "LESSONS LEARNED" : {
    "01 Introduction" : "Capturing lessons learned is an integral part of every project and serves several purposes. While the finalization of a formal lessons learned document is completed during the project closeout process, capturing lessons learned should occur throughout the project lifecycle to ensure all information is documented in a timely and accurate manner. The lessons learned document serves as a valuable tool for use by other project managers within an organization who are assigned similar projects. This document should not only describe what went wrong during a project and suggestions to avoid similar occurrences in the future, but it should also describe what went well and how similar projects may benefit from this information. This document should be communicated to the project sponsor and Project Management Office (PMO) for inclusion in the organizational assets and archives as part of the lessons learned database. If the organization does not have a PMO then other, formal means of communicating the lessons learned should be utilized to ensure all project managers are included.",
    "02 Lessons Learned Approach" : "The lessons learned approach describes how the document will be created, what it will consist of, and how lessons will be categorized. It is important that the lessons learned approach is covered in the initial stages of project planning. The reason for this is that a methodology along with an appropriate set of tools should be established to capture these lessons throughout the project’s lifecycle. A project journal is one example of a tool to capture these lessons. If no thought is given to lessons learned until project closeout then it is likely that many lessons and details will be omitted from the document. The contents of the lessons learned document should also be determined ahead of time. They should be detailed enough to provide value for future use and the contents should be consistent with other lessons learned documents or organizational standards. The categorization of lessons learned is another consideration. Many organizations categorize lessons by project lifecycle phase or by the knowledge area that the lesson applies to.",
    "03 Lessons Learned From This Project" : "The lessons learned must be communicated in a consistent manner. In addition to the categorization and description of the lesson, it is important to state what the impact was and provide a recommendation for project managers to consider on future projects.",

      "Database" : "The Lesson Learned Knowledge Base contains historical information from previous projects. It is part of the organizational project assets and provides a valuable source of information to be used by similar projects in the future. All project lessons learned and other historical information need to be transferred to this knowledge/database in order to provide one centralized repository for ease of use. This should also include information on issues and risks as well as techniques that worked well which can be applied to future projects. Most lessons learned knowledge/databases contain large amounts of information, so it is important that there is a system for cataloging this information."
    },
    "05 Lessons Learned From Previous Projects" : "The lessons learned document might also state which historical lessons learned were used on this project. This information not only shows the value of the documentation of such lessons, but it also shows which lessons are consistently applied by other similar projects. It is important to reference not only what the lesson was but from which project it was associated with.",

It is important that this summary captures the scope of the project and contains enough detail to provide a full understanding of the project. Since this document will communicate what went right and wrong with the project, as well as lessons learned and recommendations for future projects, it is imperative that this section provide enough background information to base the details in the rest of the document on.",
    "2 Project Team Staffing" : "This section provides information about who the project team consisted of. This usually includes names, titles, project role, and contact information. This information is useful when questions may arise on future projects which are similar in nature. It also provides a useful list of points of contact should more information be needed on lessons learned from the project.",
    "3  Project Deliverables (Planned vs Actual)" : "This section of the Post Project Review describes the expected outcomes of the project as it was originally planned and compares these outcomes against the actual outcomes. This is beneficial in defining any occurrences of scope creep or whether a project may not have been completed as planned. This is helpful information for lessons learned and for future project teams conducting similar projects.",
    "4 Transition to Operations" : "Here, the Post Project Review describes the transition of the project to operations upon completion. This section should include any difficulties or challenges faced during this transition. This section should also highlight what went right during the transition so future projects may reference and use best practices to improve project performance.",
    "5 Project Costs" : "This section of the Post Project Review should describe how the planned or budgeted costs for the project compare with the actual costs. Costs may be affected by scope creep, poor planning, schedule delays, progressive elaboration, or many other factors. This section should highlight whether or not costs were controlled adequately and if there were additional or excessive costs the reasons should be stated. It is important to communicate why costs were met or may have been higher than planned so future projects can benefit from this information in building a more effective project management methodology within the organization.",
    "6 Project Schedule" : "This portion of the Post Project Review describes the project’s planned schedule or timeline and how the project measured against this plan. This information is helpful in identifying and understanding what may have contributed to project delays or allowed the project to complete early or on time. This can then be used by the team members on future projects or be referenced by other project teams for use on future projects. Archiving project information during the project closure phase is one of the best ways for an organization to improve its project management methodologies and effectiveness.",
    "7 Recommendations" : "This section of the Post Project Review Template highlights any recommendations and lessons learned which would be of use on future projects. This is a valuable part of the project closeout phase and organizational project archives. In the project planning phase one of the first steps is to research organizational archives to identify useful information for planning and executing a project. These recommendations and lessons learned are one of the most important pieces or project success in any effective project management group."

  "PROCESS IMPROVEMENT PLAN" : {
    "01 Introduction" : "The process improvement plan is a component of the Project Management Plan. The purpose of the process improvement plan is to document how the project team will analyze various processes, determine where improvements can be made, and implement improvement measures. Like a large part of project management methodology, process improvement is an iterative process that is performed throughout the project’s lifetime.",
    "02 Process Boundaries" : "Process boundaries must be identified as part of the process improvement plan. This establishes where each process begins and ends as well as what the process inputs and outputs are. Additionally, there must be accountability for each process with a process owner assigned who is responsible for overseeing process improvement measures. Boundaries are important to ensure that the work being done to improve the process falls within the boundaries and not outside of the process which would result in extraneous work with no impact on the process.",
    "03 Process Configuration" : "Process configuration is an illustrated and/or graphical depiction of the project’s processes. By presenting the process configurations in this manner, the project team has the ability to visualize the processes which can be helpful in facilitating analysis, identifying area where the processes are weak, and determining ways the processes may be improved throughout the project. It is important to note that like all other project documentation, as changes are made to the processes, the configurations must be updated.",
    "04 Process Metrics" : "Metrics are an extremely important part of process improvement and project quality. A metric is a measure or measures which allow the project team to assess various performance parameters of a given process. These measures allow the team to continuously monitor, measure, and track a process’s performance in order to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. The team must ensure that metrics are based on the project or customer requirements to ensure project quality. The metrics must also be based on what comprises an acceptable measurement as well as control limits within which acceptable measurements may fall.",
    "05 Targets for Improved Performance" : "In order to effectively improve a process a project team needs a thorough understanding of where there processes currently are, as well as where they want to be at the end of the project. While processes may fall within the acceptable control limits, building quality management into the project plan requires continuous improvement throughout the project’s duration. To drive this cycle of continuous improvement, the project team needs to establish targets for each specific metric. These targets should be specific, measurable, and achievable."

The schedule baseline provides a reference point for managing project progress as it pertains to schedule and timeline. The schedule baseline and work breakdown structure (WBS) should be created in Microsoft Project. The WBS can be exported from the MS Project file. Be sure to consult our Work Breakdown Structure Template.",
    "06 Change Management Plan" : "This part of the Project Plan should describe your change control process. Ideally, this process will be some type of organizational standard which is repeatable and done on most or all projects when a change is necessary. Changes to any project must be carefully considered and the impact of the change must be clear in order to make any type of approval decisions. Many organizations have change control boards (CCBs) which review proposed changes and either approve or deny them. This is an effective way to provide oversight and ensure adequate feedback and review of the change is obtained. This section of the project plan template gives you an place where you should also identify who has approval authority for changes to the project, who submits the changes, how they are tracked and monitored.",

    "Description" : "Delegation is an essential part of a project manager's role, so identifying roles and responsibilities early in a project is important. Applying the RACI model can help. As project manager it is important that you set the expectations of people involved in your project from the outset. Projects require many people's involvement, but how do you avoid a situation where people are struggling against one another to do a task. Equally difficult is dealing with a situation where nobody will take ownership and make a decision. How do people know their level of responsibility; when they should involve you as their project manager, or when they should exercise their own judgment? The RACI model is a straightforward tool used for identifying roles and responsibilities and avoiding confusion over those roles and responsibilities during a project.",

In some cases both the roles might be taken by the same person (if the task is simple and non-critical).", "Make sure that every task has only one person assigned as “A”. Though responsibilities can be shared, accountabilities have to be fixed to a single person.", "If there are too many people in the “C” category, figure out if all of them need to be in the loop. Consider moving some of them to the “I” category. Also keep the “I” category to a minimum to reduce the noise in communication." ],
    "Introduction" : "In project management, it is very important for all the stakeholders to understand the responsibilities and accountabilities of each person. While smaller teams can have more informal rules to keep track of responsibilities, in bigger teams with cross-department and inter-organizational collaboration, it is very important to create a more formal process to track responsibilities. This helps reduce confusion and leads project to faster completion.",

The RCA also includes the follow-up actions necessary to properly address the root cause. It also highlights what root causes should/should not consist of.",
    "02 Event Description" : "This section provides a description of the event that is being analyzed. It provides a clear and concise description of the problem that triggered this Root Cause Analysis. It should state the date, time, detailed description of the event/problem, who detected the problem, who it affected, and how it affected them. It is important that the descriptions are as detailed as possible since this problem is the source of the entire RCA.",
    "03 Chronology of Events" : {
      "Timeline" : "In this section of the Root Casue Analysis you are to provide a detailed chronology of the events leading up to, and following, the problem. This is an important piece of the RCA as the chronology of events may lead to clues in determining how or why the problem occurred. Be sure to include names, times and detailed descriptions of all activities."
    },
    "04 Investigative Team and Method" : "This section of the Root Cause Analysis should describe how the investigative team is assembled, who it consists of, and how it gathers the data to be used in the analysis. As with any process, it is important in the RCA that clear roles and methodologies be established in order to allow for the process to move in a controlled and deliberate manner. This is also an important part of the RCA because a majority of time spent in RCA is gathering data about the event/problem.",
    "05 Findings and Root Cause" : "This part of the Root Cause Analysis should describe the findings of the investigation and explain the root cause(s) based on these findings. It is possible that a RCA results in findings that are not directly related to the root cause of the problem. These should also be captured as product/process improvement steps in an effort to improve the product/project. It is important to note that this section does not describe the corrective actions to be taken as a result of identifying root cause. Corrective action will be discussed separately in the next paragraph. All findings must be formally communicated with the project team in order to ensure any project changes can be made in accordance with the project’s change management process.",
    "06 Corrective Action" : "As the purpose of the Root Cause Analysis is to determine the root cause of a problem, it should result in some corrective actions that may be taken to ensure the same problem is not repeated. Often, these corrective actions will result in changes to a project’s scope, schedule, or cost. It is imperative that all of the findings and corrective actions are detailed and formally communicated with the project team so changes can go through the change management process and be implemented in the project plan upon approval."

Effectively managing stakeholders is a key component of successful project management and should never be ignored. Proper stakeholder management can be used to gain support for a project and anticipate resistance, conflict, or competing objectives among the project’s stakeholders.",
    "2 Identify Stakeholders" : "This section of the Stakeholder Management Strategy should discuss the methodology the project team will use to identify stakeholders and how stakeholders are defined. It is imperative that all stakeholders are identified regardless of how major or minor they are. This is because they will be categorized after they’re identified. If stakeholders are omitted there is a likelihood that they may become evident at some point during the project’s lifecycle and introduce delays or other obstacles to the project’s success. Great care and effort should be dedicated to this step of the Stakeholder Management Strategy.",
    "3 Key Stakeholders" : "This part of the Stakeholder Management Strategy identifies the sub-set of stakeholders who have been identified as key stakeholders and the reasoning for determining that they are key stakeholders. Key stakeholders are often those who potentially have the most influence over a project or those who may be most affected by the project. They may also be stakeholders who are resistant to the change represented by the project. These key stakeholders may require more communication and management throughout the project’s lifecycle and it is important to identify them to seek their feedback on their desired level of participation and communication.",
    "4 Stakeholder Analysis" : "Here, the Stakeholder Management Strategy describes how the project team will analyze its list of identified stakeholders. This discussion should include how stakeholders will be categorized or grouped as well as the level of impact they may have based on their power, influence, and involvement in the project. There are several tools and techniques that can be used to help quantify stakeholders. A description of these tools and techniques should also be included in this section.",
    "The following criteria will be used to determine if an individual will be included as a stakeholder" : [ null, "Will the person or their organization be directly or indirectly affected by this project?", "Does the person or their organization hold a position from which they can influence the project?", "Does the person have an impact on the project’s resources (material, personnel, funding)?", "Does the person or their organization have any special skills or capabilities the project will require?", "Does the person potentially benefit from the project or are they in a position to resist this change?" ]

This business need may be based on new technology developments, the need to reduce costs, market demand, or the creation of new legal or regulatory requirements. All projects must align with a business need and organizational strategy.",
    "3 Product Scope Description" : "This part of the Statement of Work describes the scope of the product which will be created by the project. Some of the elements to be included in this section are key characteristics of the product, features and functions of the product, and the relationship between the product and the business need it addresses. It is important to note that the product scope differs greatly from project scope. While project scope deals with all of the work involved to complete the project, product scope pertains only to the product or service which is the project’s deliverable.",
    "4 Strategic Plan" : "This section of the Statement of Work describes the organizational strategic plan and how it relates to the project and its deliverables. In an effective organization, all projects must have executive support and be aligned with organizational strategies, goals, and objectives. Approved projects, and their resulting products or services must support these strategies in order to contribute to the organization accomplishing its goals and objectives.",

There are typically several people who need to accept the handover (i.e. security office for all badges, IT Manager for system accounts, Contracts Manager, etc.).",
    "2 Transition Approach" : "This section of the contract transition out plan discusses the overall approach to the transition. Some items which must be considered are: will you scale down your staff during the transition or will you bring in additional staff to handle and manage the transition? How long is the transition? What are your assumptions (i.e. the staff of the new contractor will be available onsite to participate in the transition and receive knowledge transfer, etc.)?",
    "3 Transition Team Organization" : "This section of the transition out plan should provide an organizational chart showing all resources and their roles in the transition (i.e. Transition Project Manager, etc.). Key team members should be from both the incumbent and new contractors as well as the customer.",
    "4 Workforce Transition" : "It is not uncommon for the workforce to transition from one contractor to another as part of the contract transition. The workforce may stay in place with the client or customer and simply “re-badge” from the incumbent to the new contractor. It is also common for the incumbent workforce to leave the site once the transition is completed and approved. In order to set expectations and allow for adequate transition planning, the workforce must be determined and communicated ahead of time.",

This property may include hardware such as laptops/PCs, software bundles or add-ons, portable electronic devices (PEDs), and security badges. Typically, GFE will be turned back over to the government customer during a transition and may or may not be re-issued to the new contractor.",
      "2 Incumbent Owned Equipment" : "Equipment owned by the incumbent contractor will usually remain with them when they transition off of the contract. However, there may be instances where incumbent owned equipment supports customer applications and services. This section should state that incumbent owned equipment will remain with the incumbent - and identify options where this equipment may be available for purchase by the new contractor or customer for their use (i.e. application server and application for helpdesk, etc.).",
      "3 Intellectual Property" : "This section of the contract transition out plan should describe how intellectual property will be handled as part of the transfer process. Intellectual property may include various documentation, supplier and subcontractor information, service agreements, or original designs or plans. Intellectual property generates many legal considerations and may include the completion of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the incumbent and the customer. Intellectual property may be transferred, sold, or retained by the incumbent depending on the contractual agreements in place.",
      "4 User Accounts and Passwords" : "This section should discuss how any accounts will be transitioned, who they will be transitioned to (i.e. system administrator accounts). Provide a table of all user accounts to be transitioned/disabled."
    },
    "8 Knowledge Transfer" : "This section of the project transition out plan should discuss how knowledge will be transferred from the incumbent staff to the staff of the new contractor (documentation/instruction manuals including as-built documents, formal training classes, one-on-one training/knowledge transfer, etc.). This is an important consideration as the transfer of knowledge is what provides continuity for the contract.",
    "9 Schedule" : "This part of the transition plan should contain a GANTT chart schedule of the transition. The complexity of the transition will dictate the level of detail required in the schedule. However, all major milestones as well as transition start and completion dates should be included at a minimum."

    "01 Introduction" : "The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a view into the project which shows what work the project encompasses. It is a tool which helps to easily communicate the work and processes involved to execute the project. The Project Manager and project team use the WBS to develop the project schedule, resource requirements and costs. There are many ways you can present the WBS for your project; this template provides many of the most popular layouts from which you can choose. Depending on where in the Project Plan you're putting the WBS a different layout may be more suitable for you. For instance many Project Managers include a high level WBS within the project plan, then a detailed version as an appendix to the plan. You may find that you prefer one layout for a high level WBS and a different one for a detailed WBS.",
    "02 Outline View" : "The outline view presents an easy to view and understand layout for the WBS. It is also a good layout to use when developing the WBS because you can easily make changes, especially since the Microsoft Word auto numbering feature updates the WBS Code automatically.",
    "03 Hierarchical Structure" : "The hierarchal structure is similar to the outline view but without indentation. Although this format is more difficult to read, it may be useful where you have many levels and indenting each level would make the table to large to fit into a document.",
    "04 Tabular View" : "The Tabular View is a nicely organized table view of the WBS. It is a good option for organizations which prefer table formats.",
    "05 Tree Structure View" : "The Tree Structure View is the most popular format for the Work Breakdown Structure. It presents an easy to understand view into the WBS; however, it is also tricky to create without an application specifically designed for creating this organizational chart structure. The Tree Structure below was created using only Microsoft Word and the SmartArt graphics option under the insert menu.",
    "06 WBS Dictionary" : "The WBS Dictionary contains all the details of the Work Breakdown Structure which are necessary to successfully complete the project. Most importantly it contains a definition of each Work Package which can be thought of as a mini scope statement. Resources on the project will look at the WBS dictionary to determine the scope of the Work Package they've been assigned, so it's important to be clear when writing the definition. Most WBS dictionaries contain more information than we show in our sample. These things usually include Level of Effort, Cost Control Numbers, Resource Assignments, Responsibility Assignments - just to name a few.",
    "07 Glossary of Terms" : "It's important that you provide a glossary of terms as some of the terms are not understood by persons without a project management background. For instance what the PMI Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures refers to as the WBS Code is commonly referred to as the WBS number."

The WBS is beneficial during the planning process as it assists with determining the budget and time you will require to complete the project successfully.  Start with a whiteboard, poster board or easel pad, markers and sticky notes. Distribute Post-Its and markers to the team and ask them to write one deliverable per note, sticking them to the board in no particular order as they finish.  When you cannot think of any more deliverables, stack or discard similar sticky notes and group others in the same category. Once you have grouped all of the deliverables, create category names and write them on sticky notes placed at the top of each grouping.  Check for any deliverables you may have forgotten and add them as needed. Clarify items with the team and create new notes that are more concise. Remember to include Project Management as a category."
