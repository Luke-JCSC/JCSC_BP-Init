              <h2>The Pandorica Opens</h2>
              <p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!</p>
              <h3>Planet of the Dead</h3>
              <p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You've swallowed a planet! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</p>
              <h4>The Waters of Mars</h4>
              <p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. You hit me with a cricket bat. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>
              <h5>The Stolen Earth</h5>
              <p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</p>
              <h6>Amy's Choice</h6>
              <p>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>
