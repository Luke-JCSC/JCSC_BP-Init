With new and emerging technologies we can truly unlock the power of mobile computing. By bringing mobility to the thin client we can now bring mobility to telecomuting and allow for more productive work in areas free from teathers. This in conjunction with the Pirate Box we should be ablt to provide a working solution to those that want a complete system for a workstation that can be used as a desktop unteathered or as mobile a mobile workstation. Providing internet can allow for applications such as RDP to use servers to thier full advantage for computing horse power, or just to use it as a comunications device with VoIP technologies like Google Voice or Skype. One key componet of this machine is its power consumption, and ability to help reduce the energy requiments of operation and help make self sustainability a possibility with a few more componets. We are looking into rare earth perminate magnets to build nano sized power generating motors, to gather the 8 watts needed to power the device and keep the usb batteries charged. It may be a long shot, but this is our attempt to build a better development machine for our developers. There are more powerful and probably more streamlined solutions on the shelf collecting dust somewhere, however we need better unteathered solutions for mobile computing and access to our development networks when ever and where ever needed. Work does not hault because your access to information has cesed, so why rely on technologies that must remain teathered. Work is one activity that is hard to accomplish being teathered, so why re all our mobile business solutions teathered to phsical devices that are as stationary in fixed locations. Please feel free to investigate our progress on our development machines as we will report all our progress as we are able to document them.",

          "01 Introduction" : "Activity Cost Estimates are a valuable project management tool for determining the costs for a project. Much like how a project’s work is broken down into activities and work packages, the activity cost estimate breaks the project’s costs down to the activity level in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of the estimate.",
          "02 Description" : "The activity cost estimate considers each project activity and the costs associated with completing the activity. These costs include direct costs for project resources, indirect costs which may be passed on to the project, and the amount held in contingency reserve for the activity. A given activity may have many resources allocated to it which all must be accounted for as part of the estimate for that activity. One characteristic of the activity cost estimate is documenting how the estimate was determined. This is usually done by either analogous or parametric estimating. Analogous estimating is done using similar past projects or activities to estimate cost. Parametric estimating is done by determining and using a unit cost calculated over a duration or quantity of units. Parametric estimating is usually more accurate and should result in a higher confidence level. Another characteristic of the activity cost estimate is that it often uses a range for the activity’s cost estimate as well as a confidence level. At different stages of project planning some activities may be more well-defined which may result in a much higher confidence level than that of an activity with more unknowns. It is important to note that like most project management documentation, the activity cost estimate should continue to be revised and improved throughout the project’s lifecycle.",
          "03 Summary" : "In general, the more information and detail that is available for an activity, the more accurate the activity cost estimate will be. Once activity cost estimates are completed for all of a project’s activities, these can then be used to develop the overall project cost estimate.",

While the finalization of a formal lessons learned document is completed during the project closeout process, capturing lessons learned should occur throughout the project lifecycle to ensure all information is documented in a timely and accurate manner. The lessons learned document serves as a valuable tool for use by other project managers within an organization who are assigned similar projects. This document should not only describe what went wrong during a project and suggestions to avoid similar occurrences in the future, but it should also describe what went well and how similar projects may benefit from this information. This document should be communicated to the project sponsor and Project Management Office (PMO) for inclusion in the organizational assets and archives as part of the lessons learned database. If the organization does not have a PMO then other, formal means of communicating the lessons learned should be utilized to ensure all project managers are included.",

It is important that the lessons learned approach is covered in the initial stages of project planning. The reason for this is that a methodology along with an appropriate set of tools should be established to capture these lessons throughout the project’s lifecycle. A project journal is one example of a tool to capture these lessons. If no thought is given to lessons learned until project closeout then it is likely that many lessons and details will be omitted from the document. The contents of the lessons learned document should also be determined ahead of time. They should be detailed enough to provide value for future use and the contents should be consistent with other lessons learned documents or organizational standards. The categorization of lessons learned is another consideration. Many organizations categorize lessons by project lifecycle phase or by the knowledge area that the lesson applies to.",

By presenting the process configurations in this manner, the project team has the ability to visualize the processes which can be helpful in facilitating analysis, identifying area where the processes are weak, and determining ways the processes may be improved throughout the project. It is important to note that like all other project documentation, as changes are made to the processes, the configurations must be updated.",
          "04 Process Metrics" : "Metrics are an extremely important part of process improvement and project quality. A metric is a measure or measures which allow the project team to assess various performance parameters of a given process. These measures allow the team to continuously monitor, measure, and track a process’s performance in order to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. The team must ensure that metrics are based on the project or customer requirements to ensure project quality. The metrics must also be based on what comprises an acceptable measurement as well as control limits within which acceptable measurements may fall.",
          "05 Targets for Improved Performance" : "In order to effectively improve a process a project team needs a thorough understanding of where there processes currently are, as well as where they want to be at the end of the project. While processes may fall within the acceptable control limits, building quality management into the project plan requires continuous improvement throughout the project’s duration. To drive this cycle of continuous improvement, the project team needs to establish targets for each specific metric. These targets should be specific, measurable, and achievable."

          "01 Introduction" : "The Introduction provides a high level overview of the project and what is included in this Project Management Plan. This should include a high level description of the project and describe the projects deliverables and benefits. Excessive detail is not necessary in this section as the other sections of the project plan will include this information. This section of the project plan template should provide a summarized framework of the project and its purpose. Look back at the Project Charter for information to include in this section.",
          "02 Project Management Approach" : "This section of the Project Plan is where you outline the overall management approach for the project. This section should describe, in general terms, the roles and authority of project team members. It should also include which organizations will provide resources for the project and any resource constraints or limitations. If there are any decisions which must be made by specific individuals—for example authorizing additional funding by the project sponsor—this should also be stated here. It should be written as an Executive Summary for the Project Management Plan.",
          "03 Project Scope" : "State the scope of the project in this section of the Project Management Plan. The scope statement from the project charter should be used as a starting point; however, the project plan needs to include a much more detailed scope than the charter. This detail should include what the project does and does not include. The more detail included in this section, the better the product. This will help to clarify what is included in the project and help to avoid any confusion from project team members and stakeholders.",
          "04 Milestone List" : "Provide a summary list of milestones including dates for each milestone. Include an introductory paragraph in this section which provides some insight to the major milestones. This section of the project plan template should also mention or discuss actions taken if any changes to the milestones or delivery dates are required.",
          "05 Schedule Baseline and Work Breakdown Structure" : "This section of the Project Management Plan should discuss the WBS, WBS Dictionary, and Schedule baseline and how they will be used in managing the project’s scope. The WBS provides the work packages to be performed for the completion of the project. The WBS Dictionary defines the work packages. The schedule baseline provides a reference point for managing project progress as it pertains to schedule and timeline. The schedule baseline and work breakdown structure (WBS) should be created in Microsoft Project. The WBS can be exported from the MS Project file. Be sure to consult our Work Breakdown Structure Template.",
          "06 Change Management Plan" : "This part of the Project Plan should describe your change control process. Ideally, this process will be some type of organizational standard which is repeatable and done on most or all projects when a change is necessary. Changes to any project must be carefully considered and the impact of the change must be clear in order to make any type of approval decisions. Many organizations have change control boards (CCBs) which review proposed changes and either approve or deny them. This is an effective way to provide oversight and ensure adequate feedback and review of the change is obtained. This section of the project plan template gives you an place where you should also identify who has approval authority for changes to the project, who submits the changes, how they are tracked and monitored.",
          "07 Communications Management Plan" : "The purpose of the Communications Management Plan is to define the communication requirements for the project and how information will be distributed to ensure project success. You should give considerable thought to how you want to manage communications on every project. By having a solid communications management approach you’ll find that many project management problems can be avoided. In this section you should provide an overview of your communications management approach. Generally, the Communications Management Plan defines the following: Communication requirements based on roles What information will be communicated How the information will be communicated When will information be distributed Who does the communication Who receives the communication Communications conduct For larger and more complex projects, the Communications Management Plan may be included as an appendix or separate document apart from the Project Management Plan. We have a detailed Communications Management Plan Template available on our website.",
          "08 Cost Management Plan" : "The Cost Management Plan clearly defines how the costs on a project will be managed throughout the project’s lifecycle. It sets the format and standards by which the project costs are measured, reported, and controlled. Working within the cost management guidelines is imperative for all project team members to ensure successful completion of the project. These guidelines may include which level of the WBS cost accounts will be created in and the establishment of acceptable variances. The Cost Management Plan: Identifies who is responsible for managing costs Identifies who has the authority to approve changes to the project or its budget How cost performance is quantitatively measured and reported upon Report formats, frequency and to whom they are presented For complex or large projects the Cost Management Plan may be included as an appendix to the Project Plan or as a separate, stand-alone document. In addition to this project plan template we have a detailed Cost Management Plan Template available on our website.",
          "09 Procurement Management Plan" : "The Procurement Management Plan should be defined enough to clearly identify the necessary steps and responsibilities for procurement from the beginning to the end of a project. The project manager must ensure that the plan facilitates the successful completion of the project and does not become an overwhelming task in itself to manage. The project manager will work with the project team, contracts/purchasing department, and other key players to manage the procurement activities. For larger projects or projects with more complicated procurement management requirements, you can include the Procurement Management Plan as a separate document apart from the Project Management Plan. In addition to this Project Plan Template we have a detailed Procurement Management Plan Template available on our website.",
          "10 Project Scope Management Plan" : "It is important that the approach to managing the projects’ scope be clearly defined and documented in detail. Failure to clearly establish and communicate project scope can result in delays, unnecessary work, failure to achieve deliverables, cost overruns, or other unintended consequences. This section provides a summary of the Scope Management Plan in which it addresses the following: Who has authority and responsibility for scope management How the scope is defined (i.e. Scope Statement, WBS, WBS Dictionary, Statement of Work, etc.) How the scope is measured and verified (i.e. Quality Checklists, Scope Baseline, Work Performance Measurements, etc.) The scope change process (who initiates, who authorizes, etc.) Who is responsible for accepting the final project deliverable and approves acceptance of project scope We have a detailed Scope Management Plan Template available on our website which can be included as an appendix to the Project Management Plan for larger or more complex projects. Be sure to review it and determine if it's necessary for managing your project.",
          "11 Schedule Management Plan" : "This section of the Project Plan provides a general framework for the approach which will be taken to create the project schedule. Effective schedule management is necessary for ensuring tasks are completed on time, resources are allocated appropriately, and to help measure project performance. This section of the Project Plan should include discussion of the scheduling tool/format, schedule milestones, and schedule development roles and responsibilities. Be sure to check out the detailed Schedule Management Plan Template available on our website. The separate Schedule Management Plan is suitable for larger projects or projects where the schedule management is more formalized. The Schedule Management Plan can be broken out as an appendix to the Project Plan.",
          "12 Quality Management Plan" : "This portion of the Project Management Plan Template discusses how quality management will be used to ensure that the deliverables for the project meet a formally established standard of acceptance. All project deliverables should be defined in order to provide a foundation and understanding of the tasks at hand and what work must be planned. Quality management is the process by which the organization not only completes the work, but completes the work to an acceptable standard. Without a thorough Quality Management Plan, work may be completed in a substandard or unacceptable manner. This section should include quality roles and responsibilities, quality control, quality assurance, and quality monitoring. For larger or more complex projects, the Quality Management Plan may be included as an appendix or separate document from the Project Management Plan. A detailed Quality Management Plan Template is available for use on our website.",
          "13 Risk Management Plan" : "This part of the Project Plan provides a general description for the approach taken to identify and manage the risks associated with the project. It should be a short paragraph or two summarizing the approach to risk management on this project. Since risk management is a science in itself, we have many risk management templates available on our website. Look for the detailed Risk Management Plan Template, Risk Register Template along with our article on how to perform a risk assessment meeting.",
          "13a Risk Register" : "The Risk Register for this project is provided in Appendix Risk Register.",
          "14 Staffing Management Plan" : "Here the Project Plan Template discusses how you plan to staff the project. This section should include discussion on matrixed or projectized organizational structure depending on which is being used for this project. This section of the project plan should also include how resources will be procured and managed as well as the key resources needed for the project.",
          "15 Resource Calendar" : "Include a Resource Calendar as part of your project plan. The resource calendar identifies key resources needed for the project and the times/durations they'll be needed. Some resources may be needed for the entire length of the project while others may only be required for a portion of the project. This information must be agreed to by the Project Sponsor and Functional Managers prior to beginning the project.",
          "16 Cost Baseline" : "This section of the Project Plan Template contains the cost baseline for the project upon which cost management will be based. The project will use earned value metrics to track and manage costs and the cost baseline provides the basis for the tracking, reporting, and management of costs.",
          "17 Quality Baseline" : "This section of the Project Management Plan should include the quality baseline for the project. The purpose of this baseline is to provide a basis for ensuring that quality can be measured to determine if acceptable quality levels have been achieved. It is important for all projects to clearly define and communicate quality standards and the quality baseline serves this purpose. This is why the quality baseline is included in the Project Management Plan Template."

In your project you need to decide which metrics to monitor, but be sure not to include too many as you may end up providing the same information but in different forms. We like to track SV, SPI, CV and CPI in the layout below. Next to the schedule and cost headings you should state whether the project is ahead of or behind schedule and over or under budget. Notice we left out the word on - it is highly unlikely that you. If you like you can also include a paragraph at the beginning of this section of the project status report presenting the earned value results in verbose.",
          "Open Change Requests" : "Use this section of the project status report to track all changes to the project and report the status of those changes. Tracking of changes starts with the request for the change, tracks the approval status and ends when the change is added to the project, the project plan and schedule update and it has become a part of the project.",
          "Open Issues" : "This part of the project status report should contain a list of open issues along with their status.",

          "Project Status Summary" : "This section of the project status report provides a quick executive overview of the status of the project. It is intended for high level management so it should not get too much into the details of the project. However, it should highlight anything specific which should be brought to their attention. The Scope/Schedule/Cost/Quality table above is a quick way to present a color coded dashboard for the status report. Typically a variance of +/- 5% will warrant a yellow cautionary color and +/- 10% will warrant a red warning color. For a project which needs tighter control +/- 2% and +/- 5% are used for these thresholds; whereas, other projects with less strict control may use 10% and 20% variances. The percent complete here should be the percent completion of the entire project. For any constraint which is yellow or red this section should contain brief explanation the reason why.",

As project manager it is important that you set the expectations of people involved in your project from the outset. Projects require many people's involvement, but how do you avoid a situation where people are struggling against one another to do a task. Equally difficult is dealing with a situation where nobody will take ownership and make a decision. How do people know their level of responsibility; when they should involve you as their project manager, or when they should exercise their own judgment? The RACI model is a straightforward tool used for identifying roles and responsibilities and avoiding confusion over those roles and responsibilities during a project.",

Corrective action will be discussed separately in the next paragraph. All findings must be formally communicated with the project team in order to ensure any project changes can be made in accordance with the project’s change management process.",
          "06 Corrective Action" : "As the purpose of the Root Cause Analysis is to determine the root cause of a problem, it should result in some corrective actions that may be taken to ensure the same problem is not repeated. Often, these corrective actions will result in changes to a project’s scope, schedule, or cost. It is imperative that all of the findings and corrective actions are detailed and formally communicated with the project team so changes can go through the change management process and be implemented in the project plan upon approval."

          "1 Introduction" : "This section of the Stakeholder Management Strategy should introduce and discuss the goals and objectives of the Stakeholder Management Strategy for the project. Effectively managing stakeholders is a key component of successful project management and should never be ignored. Proper stakeholder management can be used to gain support for a project and anticipate resistance, conflict, or competing objectives among the project’s stakeholders.",
          "2 Identify Stakeholders" : "This section of the Stakeholder Management Strategy should discuss the methodology the project team will use to identify stakeholders and how stakeholders are defined. It is imperative that all stakeholders are identified regardless of how major or minor they are. This is because they will be categorized after they’re identified. If stakeholders are omitted there is a likelihood that they may become evident at some point during the project’s lifecycle and introduce delays or other obstacles to the project’s success. Great care and effort should be dedicated to this step of the Stakeholder Management Strategy.",
          "3 Key Stakeholders" : "This part of the Stakeholder Management Strategy identifies the sub-set of stakeholders who have been identified as key stakeholders and the reasoning for determining that they are key stakeholders. Key stakeholders are often those who potentially have the most influence over a project or those who may be most affected by the project. They may also be stakeholders who are resistant to the change represented by the project. These key stakeholders may require more communication and management throughout the project’s lifecycle and it is important to identify them to seek their feedback on their desired level of participation and communication.",
          "4 Stakeholder Analysis" : "Here, the Stakeholder Management Strategy describes how the project team will analyze its list of identified stakeholders. This discussion should include how stakeholders will be categorized or grouped as well as the level of impact they may have based on their power, influence, and involvement in the project. There are several tools and techniques that can be used to help quantify stakeholders. A description of these tools and techniques should also be included in this section.",
          "The following criteria will be used to determine if an individual will be included as a stakeholder" : [ null, "Will the person or their organization be directly or indirectly affected by this project?", "Does the person or their organization hold a position from which they can influence the project?", "Does the person have an impact on the project’s resources (material, personnel, funding)?", "Does the person or their organization have any special skills or capabilities the project will require?", "Does the person potentially benefit from the project or are they in a position to resist this change?" ]

Be sure to look at the many other templates available for free on our website.",
          "2 Business Need" : "This section of the Statement of Work (SOW) describes the business need of the organization which resulted in the creation of the project. This business need may be based on new technology developments, the need to reduce costs, market demand, or the creation of new legal or regulatory requirements. All projects must align with a business need and organizational strategy.",
          "3 Product Scope Description" : "This part of the Statement of Work describes the scope of the product which will be created by the project. Some of the elements to be included in this section are key characteristics of the product, features and functions of the product, and the relationship between the product and the business need it addresses. It is important to note that the product scope differs greatly from project scope. While project scope deals with all of the work involved to complete the project, product scope pertains only to the product or service which is the project’s deliverable.",
          "4 Strategic Plan" : "This section of the Statement of Work describes the organizational strategic plan and how it relates to the project and its deliverables. In an effective organization, all projects must have executive support and be aligned with organizational strategies, goals, and objectives. Approved projects, and their resulting products or services must support these strategies in order to contribute to the organization accomplishing its goals and objectives.",
          "5 Approvals" : "The project Statement of Work (SOW) is a document with which approval is granted or denied to move forward with the creation of a project charter. Therefore, the document should receive approval or disapproval from its executive review board.",
          "summary" : "This section of the Statement of Work (SOW) should provide a summary of the business need the organization is addressing with the project, the scope and characteristics of the product or project deliverable, and how the project and product align with the corporate strategy, goals, and objectives. The executive summary should consist of high-level language which provides a framework of the detail included in the subsequent SOW sections. This section may be completed last as the purpose is to summarize the details included in the other sections of the SOW."

This section of the transition plan should include an overview and history of the contract, who the contract is currently with, who it is transitioning to, and the timeframe/period of transition.",
          "10 Handover and Acceptance" : "This section of the contract transition out plan should discuss how the customer will formally accept the handover at the end of the transition. This may include whether or not there’s a checklist for acceptance or formal sign-off. There are typically several people who need to accept the handover (i.e. security office for all badges, IT Manager for system accounts, Contracts Manager, etc.).",
          "2 Transition Approach" : "This section of the contract transition out plan discusses the overall approach to the transition. Some items which must be considered are: will you scale down your staff during the transition or will you bring in additional staff to handle and manage the transition? How long is the transition? What are your assumptions (i.e. the staff of the new contractor will be available onsite to participate in the transition and receive knowledge transfer, etc.)?",
          "3 Transition Team Organization" : "This section of the transition out plan should provide an organizational chart showing all resources and their roles in the transition (i.e. Transition Project Manager, etc.). Key team members should be from both the incumbent and new contractors as well as the customer.",
          "4 Workforce Transition" : "It is not uncommon for the workforce to transition from one contractor to another as part of the contract transition. The workforce may stay in place with the client or customer and simply “re-badge” from the incumbent to the new contractor. It is also common for the incumbent workforce to leave the site once the transition is completed and approved. In order to set expectations and allow for adequate transition planning, the workforce must be determined and communicated ahead of time.",
          "5 Work Execution During Transition" : "Discuss the level of work which is to be performed during the transition period and the impact of the transition on that work (i.e. system maintenance, software development, support services, etc.).",
          "6 Subcontracts" : "Here the project transition out plan documents all the existing contracts and if/how they will be transitioned. It should contain this information in a table format (subcontract agreements, software/hardware maintenance contracts, etc.).",
          "7 Property Transition" : {
            "1 Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)" : "This section of the transition plan describes the transition of any equipment for a scenario where the customer is a government entity and provides the contractor with government property. This property may include hardware such as laptops/PCs, software bundles or add-ons, portable electronic devices (PEDs), and security badges. Typically, GFE will be turned back over to the government customer during a transition and may or may not be re-issued to the new contractor.",
            "2 Incumbent Owned Equipment" : "Equipment owned by the incumbent contractor will usually remain with them when they transition off of the contract. However, there may be instances where incumbent owned equipment supports customer applications and services. This section should state that incumbent owned equipment will remain with the incumbent - and identify options where this equipment may be available for purchase by the new contractor or customer for their use (i.e. application server and application for helpdesk, etc.).",
            "3 Intellectual Property" : "This section of the contract transition out plan should describe how intellectual property will be handled as part of the transfer process. Intellectual property may include various documentation, supplier and subcontractor information, service agreements, or original designs or plans. Intellectual property generates many legal considerations and may include the completion of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) between the incumbent and the customer. Intellectual property may be transferred, sold, or retained by the incumbent depending on the contractual agreements in place.",
            "4 User Accounts and Passwords" : "This section should discuss how any accounts will be transitioned, who they will be transitioned to (i.e. system administrator accounts). Provide a table of all user accounts to be transitioned/disabled."
          },
          "8 Knowledge Transfer" : "This section of the project transition out plan should discuss how knowledge will be transferred from the incumbent staff to the staff of the new contractor (documentation/instruction manuals including as-built documents, formal training classes, one-on-one training/knowledge transfer, etc.). This is an important consideration as the transfer of knowledge is what provides continuity for the contract.",
          "9 Schedule" : "This part of the transition plan should contain a GANTT chart schedule of the transition. The complexity of the transition will dictate the level of detail required in the schedule. However, all major milestones as well as transition start and completion dates should be included at a minimum."

          "01 Introduction" : "The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a view into the project which shows what work the project encompasses. It is a tool which helps to easily communicate the work and processes involved to execute the project. The Project Manager and project team use the WBS to develop the project schedule, resource requirements and costs. There are many ways you can present the WBS for your project; this template provides many of the most popular layouts from which you can choose. Depending on where in the Project Plan you're putting the WBS a different layout may be more suitable for you. For instance many Project Managers include a high level WBS within the project plan, then a detailed version as an appendix to the plan. You may find that you prefer one layout for a high level WBS and a different one for a detailed WBS.",
          "02 Outline View" : "The outline view presents an easy to view and understand layout for the WBS. It is also a good layout to use when developing the WBS because you can easily make changes, especially since the Microsoft Word auto numbering feature updates the WBS Code automatically.",
          "03 Hierarchical Structure" : "The hierarchal structure is similar to the outline view but without indentation. Although this format is more difficult to read, it may be useful where you have many levels and indenting each level would make the table to large to fit into a document.",
          "04 Tabular View" : "The Tabular View is a nicely organized table view of the WBS. It is a good option for organizations which prefer table formats.",
          "05 Tree Structure View" : "The Tree Structure View is the most popular format for the Work Breakdown Structure. It presents an easy to understand view into the WBS; however, it is also tricky to create without an application specifically designed for creating this organizational chart structure. The Tree Structure below was created using only Microsoft Word and the SmartArt graphics option under the insert menu.",
          "06 WBS Dictionary" : "The WBS Dictionary contains all the details of the Work Breakdown Structure which are necessary to successfully complete the project. Most importantly it contains a definition of each Work Package which can be thought of as a mini scope statement. Resources on the project will look at the WBS dictionary to determine the scope of the Work Package they've been assigned, so it's important to be clear when writing the definition. Most WBS dictionaries contain more information than we show in our sample. These things usually include Level of Effort, Cost Control Numbers, Resource Assignments, Responsibility Assignments - just to name a few.",
          "07 Glossary of Terms" : "It's important that you provide a glossary of terms as some of the terms are not understood by persons without a project management background. For instance what the PMI Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures refers to as the WBS Code is commonly referred to as the WBS number."

Distribute Post-Its and markers to the team and ask them to write one deliverable per note, sticking them to the board in no particular order as they finish.  When you cannot think of any more deliverables, stack or discard similar sticky notes and group others in the same category. Once you have grouped all of the deliverables, create category names and write them on sticky notes placed at the top of each grouping.  Check for any deliverables you may have forgotten and add them as needed. Clarify items with the team and create new notes that are more concise.

Enhanced user controls with ajax, silver light and SQL handling in code base to decrease effort needed going forward with conversion from VB6 to .Net 4.0. Providing better user controls decreases the need for a form by form development of standard reusable control types. Developed application controls using Silverlight, ASP.Net, Ajax to show proof of concept and a frame work for converting classic asp applications to .Net.  Custom user controls were used to keep development time down on future projects and allow faster turnaround time with controls to be used for standard data gathering.  These controls connect and retrieve data from a database just by setting the property for the stored procedure or SQL statement to call.  Properties were also provided to allow ease of use on non standard Databases and for growth in the future. Used Clear Case for source Control, Visual Studio 2005, SQL Server 200/2005, Oracle, Silverlight, Ajax, VB.Net, ASP.Net, and small amounts of CSS and JavaScript. ",

The concept was to track help desk tickets and time spent during different stages of the process, and gauge the work load capacity of each team member. This dashboard would also be used to track the need to scale up or down the work force with work load trends. Used VM Ware Workstation/Server/ESXi to create and deploy test and production environments for the application. This needed to test production SQL Servers, and Linked Servers to an Oracle Data Mart. As this data was limited and time sensitive, the linked server needed to feed the needed information into SQL server, where it could be processed and left in a format easier to compute information needed by the dashboard. The application was built with VB.Net, Ajax, Silverlight and SQL Scripts, using some Infragistics and Telerik controls to increase usability and decrease development times. By linking databases and creating custom queries to represent the usable data from the 4 systems, Relevant information was extracted and displayed in graphs and in a manor that management could use and understand to prove their efforts were meeting SLA's and begin tracking the information to make more informed decisions.
